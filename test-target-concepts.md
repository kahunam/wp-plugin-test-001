## Test Case 1: Royal Mail PECR Fine

**Title:** "Royal Mail fined £20,000 under PECR for marketing automation gone wrong"

**Organization:** Royal Mail
**Industry:** Postal/mail service

**Target Visual Concepts (in order of preference):**
1. ✅ **BEST:** Stack of letters and envelopes on a wooden desk or table
2. ✅ **BEST:** Close-up of a residential letterbox (mail slot in door)
3. ✅ **BEST:** Canvas mail sacks in a sorting room
4. ✅ **GOOD:** Rows of postal sorting slots/cubbyholes with mail
5. ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE:** Generic white delivery van with packages (no people)
6. ❌ **AVOID:** People in uniforms
7. ❌ **AVOID:** Branded vehicles or post boxes
8. ❌ **AVOID:** Company logos or text

**Current Result Analysis:**
- Shows: Delivery person + unbranded van
- Status: Acceptable but not ideal
- Issue: Still includes person (introduces uniform ambiguity)
- Improvement needed: Focus on inanimate objects only

## Guidelines for All Tests

**Preferred approach:**
- Identify organization → identify industry → show GENERIC OBJECTS from that industry
- Prioritize inanimate objects over people
- Prioritize common/universal items over specific branded items
- No text, logos, uniforms, or organizational identifiers

**Examples:**
- Banking → stacks of coins, calculator, ledger book
- Technology → laptop on desk, server room, circuit boards
- Retail → shopping bags, store shelves with products
- Healthcare → stethoscope, medical equipment (no people)
- Education → books, classroom desks, chalkboard
